Choose Item or Customer to use the set of posting accounts as default accounts.
Many of the posting accounts you assign to customer records in Receivables
Management and to items in Inventory Control are used to track similar
revenue or expense accounts. For example, you can assign different posting
accounts to track Cost of Goods Sold amounts for individual items and for
customers. Choose the posting accounts assigned to items, or those assigned to
customers, to be suggested as default entries if the items and customers aren’t
assigned matching posting accounts
